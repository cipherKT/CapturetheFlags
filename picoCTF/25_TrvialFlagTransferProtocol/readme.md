# start 
start by downloading file. open it in wireshark, get the objects out since there are files transferred between two IPs.
now if you open the .deb file you will notice that `steghide` has been used in this so use the steghide. but we need passphrase 
this might be in one of the two text files available and they are encrypted so the passphrace is available in `plan` file and it is `DUEDILIGENCE` 
so run the steghide on all three pictures. third one return text file containing the flag and got the flag 

# boom !!!
