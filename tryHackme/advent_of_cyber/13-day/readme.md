# Advent of cyber 2024 day 4
Start by accessing the machines using your desired option. I used openvpn to connect to the vpn and then access the IP.<br>
This is a website that is used to monitor the traffic to server and it contains too many good options like filtering using dates, filtering the sourceIP and type of the process and others are there too you can explore them.<br>
This was pretty easy task as it was fully guided room read the instruction carefully and you will be able to complete this room in less than an hour. <br> 

## Writeup
In this room open the `burpsuiate` and you can set the `proxy` in your own `firefox` browser i did that and now i am intercepting the traffic as shown on thm follow the steps to get the first flag then for second flag it says in hint that you should send the message as mayor and then you should do the exact same thing send the message and check for the user id it will be 5 change it to mayor's id i.e. `8` and you will get the flag. 

1. What is the value of Flag1?
```bash
THM{dude_where_is_my_car}
```
